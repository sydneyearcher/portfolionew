                    <h2>My Experience</h2>
                    <p> For as long as I can remember, technology has been a huge part of my life. I believe that
                        technology
                        has greatly shaped
                        and inspired me to become the person I am today. This has also helped to steer me in the
                        direction
                        of Web Design.
                        In college I started off in Computer Science. Although pursuing that degree was challenging and
                        interesting it didn't
                        seem to be the right fit. In 2022, I decided to switch to Web Design and begin my journey
                        learning
                        about UX/UI, and have
                        been working ever since to earn my Bachelors and hopefully Masters in the future.</p>
                    <p>Web Design has opened me to a plethora of experiences. I had the pleasure of learning about how
                        the
                        mind interacts with
                        technology and different types of applications across all devices. I have also learned how to
                        apply
                        artistic and graphic
                        design techniques into the applications I make, while also sharpening my coding skills across
                        many
                        different coding
                        languages.</p>
                    <p>My experience progressing through the Web Design degree has also helped me to learn how to be a
                        leader but also a team
                        player. Collaborating on group projects and assignments in this degree has prepared me to become
                        a
                        hard worker when it
                        comes to creating meaningful and helpful relationships in the workplace. I have learned to be
                        strong
                        and diligent, but
                        have also learned to have empathy and work with others. I also feel that this has further helped
                        me
                        to become flexible
                        in any situation.</p>
                    <p>I have great interests in all things related to pop culture, politics and literature. This helps
                        me
                        to stay in tune
                        with what is popular which I believe greatly helps me in the graphic design aspect of Web
                        Design. I
                        also feel that I
                        have created a portfolio that showcases an expansive knowledge of client-side and server-side
                        scripting, a skill that
                        I feel is extremely important in this field.</p>
